print("Please enter your name: ") 
# The above code uses the string datatype to ask the the user what his/her name is.

name = input() 
# "name" is assigned as a variable, because of the "=" sign. The variable is equal to input, meaning that whatever the user types in will be stored in this variable. In other words, name is equal to the value of input. I closed the input function with parentheses so the value will be taken and stored correctly.

print("Hello", name)
#This displays the message "Hello" in string, followed by the variable, which will be the name the user typed and that was stored inside it earlier.
